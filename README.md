Grading System

This is a code that takes users input to show grading score from A-F. An user can enter any number from 0-100 to find out what the grade will be a failing or a passing course grade.    

Getting Started

These instructions will guide the user on your local machine to practice with different numbers to see which letter grade it falls on. 

Prerequisites

The grading system requires a pyhton IDE to run and test the theory.

The command bellow  will take user's grade input form 0-100:

number_grade = int(input("Enter your grade here"))

Running

Once an user choose a grade, python will run the code and choose which letter grade belongs to that grade. for example, if the user chooses an 88, the program will print (letter_grade is B+).
